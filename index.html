    <p>Energy healing is a holistic practice that activates the body's subtle energy systems to remove blocks. By
      breaking through these energetic blocks, the body's inherent ability to heal itself is stimulated.</p>
    <p>We all learned in high school physics class that matter is made up of molecules. Even something that is solid,
      such as a table, is vibrating all the time. As humans, we, too, are vibrating. When you say someone has "good
      vibes," you are really talking about that person's vibrational energy—and happy people tend to vibrate on a higher
      frequency.</p>
      <p>Places have vibes too. When you walk into a room in which a fight has just occurred, you may feel a dense energy
      that makes you want to leave right away. The beach has a light vibe due to the salt (a natural energy cleanser)
      and moving air. The air at the beach vibrates at a higher frequency as well.</p>
    <p>There are many types of energy healers, and you can find them practically everywhere (You might even be an energy
      healer yourself!). One of the oldest and most traditional though is <strong>Reiki</strong>.</p>

      <h3>What is Reiki?</h3>
      <p>Reiki is an energy healing technique that promotes relaxation, reduces stress and anxiety through gentle touch.
        Reiki practitioners use their hands to deliver energy to your body, improving the flow and balance of your energy
        to support healing.</p>
      <p>Mikao Usui developed reiki in the early 1900s, deriving the term from the Japanese words rei, meaning
        “universal,” and ki, which refers to the vital life force energy that flows through all living things. Now, reiki
        is used all over the world, including in hospitals and hospices, to complement other forms of health treatments.
      </p>
  
      <p><em>Reiki aids in healing by helping people become energetically balanced — physically, emotionally, mentally and
          spiritually.</em></p>
    </div>
    <div class="right-box">
      <h3>What happens during a Reiki session?</h3>
      <p>Reiki treatments typically last about 50 minutes. During a session, you’ll lie on a massage table fully clothed,
        as your reiki practitioner gently places their hands, palms down, on or just above your body in specific energy
        locations. They use a series of 12 to 15 different hand positions.</p>
      <p><em>The length of time that the practitioner leaves their hands in each position is determined by the flow of
          energy through their hands at each location.</em></p>
      <p>Reiki differs from other touch therapies in that there is no pressure, massage or manipulation involved.</p>

      <h3>The health benefits of Reiki</h3>
      Reiki promotes relaxation, stress reduction and symptom relief to improve overall health and well-being. It can:
      <ul>
        <li>Bring on a meditative state.</li>
        <li>Foster tissue and bone healing after injury or surgery.</li>
        <li>Stimulate your body's immune system.</li>
        <li>Promote natural self-healing.</li>

        <li>Support the well-being of people receiving traditional medical treatments such as:<br>chemotherapy, radiation,
          surgery and kidney dialysis.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>Studies show that reiki treatment may create feelings of:</p>

    <h3>What Is Tarot?</h3>
    <p>The Tarot is a deck of 78 cards, each with its own imagery, symbolism and story. The 22 Major Arcana
      cards represent life's karmic and spiritual lessons, and the 56 Minor Arcana cards reflect the trials and
      tribulations that we experience on a daily basis.</p>
    <p>Some may say that Tarot cards are simply ink on paper. However, what I have discovered from reading the Tarot
      cards daily for over twenty years is this: Tarot is the storybook of our life, the mirror to our soul, and the key
      to our inner wisdom.</p>
    <p>Every spiritual lesson we meet in our lives can be found in the seventy-eight Tarot cards. And when we consult
      the Tarot, we'll get shown the exact lessons we need to learn and master to live an inspired life. It’s like
      holding up a mirror to yourself so that you can access your subconscious mind and tap into the wisdom (and
      answers) that lives in us all.</p>
    <p>Tarot is perfect for self-development, making choices, manifesting goals, coaching others, planning a business,
      meditating—you name it. Simply ask a question, pull a card, and dive into the imagery of the card to give you
      instant access to your inner wisdom and the answer you need.</p></div>
    <div class="right-box">
      <h3>How Does The Tarot Work?</h3>
    <p>While many people believe that Tarot will tell you the future, making predictions are not really what Tarot cards
      are about.</p>
    <p>When it comes to Tarot, fortune-telling is out, and intuition is in, especially if you want to create your ideal
      future and manifest your goals.</p>
    <p>The most powerful way to read the Tarot is to use the cards to access your intuition and your inner wisdom. The
      imagery in the cards give you instant access to your subconscious mind and your intuition. And from this place of
      inner power and wisdom, you can discover how to make positive changes now so you can manifest your goals and your
      dreams in the future.</p>
    <p>Hearing advice from professional readers can help guide your journey — because everyone has their own tips. As a
      professional astrologer and tarot reader, I find that taking notes in a journal of all the cards you’re pulling on
      a regular basis is helpful. My great grandmother, who read tarot during the Great Depression, taught me that if
      you are seeing similar cards over and over that they are trying to tell you a message. Keeping track of your tarot
      pulls can help you see the patterns and themes to pay attention to.</p>
    </div>
      <div class="center-box float-clear">
    <h3>Tarot as a Tool for Our Times</h3>
    <p>Tarot is used as a form of cartomancy in which practitioners draw cards to gain insight around a situation.</p>
    <ul><li>The 78 cards in the deck each represent a different energy.<br>Through interpreting the cards that arise in a reading,
      people can make predictions or simply tell a story.</li>
    <li>Tarot’s uses are more versatile than pop culture makes it seem.<br>The cards can be used as a companion for therapy, a springboard for journaling, or a storytelling resource.<br>Essentially, they can be anything you want them to be.</li>
    <li>While you can certainly visit a tarot practitioner for a reading, you can also learn to read your own tarot
      cards.<br>That way, you can define your relationship with them and determine how they can fit into your life.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Becoming acquainted with all 78 cards can be daunting and challenging, especially in the beginning. <br>The deck is
      separated into 22 Major Arcana cards, which are thematically significant, <br>and then 56 cards split up into four
      suits, each with a different energy.</p>
