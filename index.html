      <h2>We are creatures of Light!</h2>
      
      <p>Energy healing is a holistic practice that activates the body's subtle energy systems to remove blocks. By breaking through these energetic blocks, the body's inherent ability to heal itself is stimulated.</p>
      <p>We all learned in high school physics class that matter is made up of molecules. Even something that is solid, such as a table, is vibrating all the time. As humans, we, too, are vibrating. When you say someone has "good vibes," you are really talking about that person's vibrational energy—and happy people tend to vibrate on a higher frequency.
        Places have vibes too. When you walk into a room in which a fight has just occurred, you may feel a dense energy that makes you want to leave right away. The beach has a light vibe due to the salt (a natural energy cleanser) and moving air. The air at the beach vibrates at a higher frequency as well.</p>
      <p>There are many types of energy healers, and you can find them practically everywhere (You might even be an energy healer yourself!). One of the oldest and most traditional though is <strong>Reiki</strong>.</p>

    <h2>What is Reiki?</h2>
<p>Reiki is an energy healing technique that promotes relaxation, reduces stress and anxiety through gentle touch. Reiki practitioners use their hands to deliver energy to your body, improving the flow and balance of your energy to support healing.</p>
<p>Mikao Usui developed reiki in the early 1900s, deriving the term from the Japanese words rei, meaning “universal,” and ki, which refers to the vital life force energy that flows through all living things. Now, reiki is used all over the world, including in hospitals and hospices, to complement other forms of health treatments.</p>

<p><em>Reiki aids in healing by helping people become energetically balanced — physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually.</em></p>

<h2>The health benefits of Reiki</h2>
Reiki promotes relaxation, stress reduction and symptom relief to improve overall health and well-being. It can:
<ul>
<li>Bring on a meditative state.</li>
<li>Foster tissue and bone healing after injury or surgery.</li>
<li>Stimulate your body’s immune system.</li>
<li>Promote natural self-healing.</li>
<li>Relieve pain and tension.</li>
<li>Support the well-being of people receiving traditional medical treatments such as chemotherapy, radiation, surgery and kidney dialysis.</li>
  </ul>
    
<p>Studies show that reiki treatment may create feelings of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Peace.</li>
<li>Relaxation.</li>
<li>Security.</li>
<li>Wellness.</li>
  </ul>
    
   <h2>How does Reiki work?</h2>
 <p>Reiki practitioners act as a conduit between you and the source of the universal life force energy. The energy flows through the practitioner’s hands to you.</p>
<p><em>The patient determines the energy flow from the practitioner’s hands by taking only what they need. This helps the patient know that we are supporting them only in what they need rather than what we think they need. This makes it the perfect balance to meet the patient’s needs.</em></p>
    
<h2>What happens during a Reiki session?</h2>
<p>Reiki treatments typically last about 50 minutes. During a session, you’ll lie on a massage table fully clothed, as your reiki practitioner gently places their hands, palms down, on or just above your body in specific energy locations. They use a series of 12 to 15 different hand positions.</p>
<p><em>The length of time that the practitioner leaves their hands in each position is determined by the flow of energy through their hands at each location.</em></p>
<p>Reiki differs from other touch therapies in that there is no pressure, massage or manipulation involved.</p>   
    
    <h2>What does Reiki feel like?</h2>
 <p>You may experience the energy in the form of sensations like heat, tingling or pulsing where the Reiki practitioner has placed their hands. Sometimes, people feel sensations moving throughout the body, while other people do not perceive any change at all. Most people feel very relaxed and peaceful during reiki treatment, and many fall asleep during the process.</p>

    <h2>What Is Tarot, Really?</h2>
    <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3088369/pexels-photo-3088369.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=2" alt="assorted cards on the table">
    <p class="left">The Tarot is a deck of 78 cards, each with its own imagery, symbolism and story. The 22 Major Arcana cards represent life's karmic and spiritual lessons, and the 56 Minor Arcana cards reflect the trials and tribulations that we experience on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Some may say that Tarot cards are simply ink on paper. However, what I have discovered from reading the Tarot cards daily for over twenty years is this: Tarot is the storybook of our life, the mirror to our soul, and the key to our inner wisdom.</p>
<p>Every spiritual lesson we meet in our lives can be found in the seventy-eight Tarot cards. And when we consult the Tarot, we’ll get shown the exact lessons we need to learn and master to live an inspired life. It’s like holding up a mirror to yourself so that you can access your subconscious mind and tap into the wisdom (and answers) that lives in us all.</p>
<p>Tarot is perfect for self-development, making choices, manifesting goals, coaching others, planning a business, meditating—you name it. Simply ask a question, pull a card, and dive into the imagery of the card to give you instant access to your inner wisdom and the answer you need.</p>
    <h2 class="float-clear">How Does The Tarot Work?</h2>
<p>While many people believe that Tarot will tell you the future, making predictions are not really what Tarot cards are about.</p>
<p>When it comes to Tarot, fortune-telling is out, and intuition is in, especially if you want to create your ideal future and manifest your goals.</p>
<p>The most powerful way to read the Tarot is to use the cards to access your intuition and your inner wisdom. The imagery in the cards give you instant access to your subconscious mind and your intuition. And from this place of inner power and wisdom, you can discover how to make positive changes now so you can manifest your goals and your dreams in the future.</p>
   <h2>Tarot as a Tool for Our Times</h2>
    <p>Tarot is used as a form of cartomancy in which practitioners draw cards to gain insight around a situation. The 78 cards in the deck each represent a different energy. Through interpreting the cards that arise in a reading, people can make predictions or simply tell a story. But tarot’s uses are more versatile than pop culture makes it seem. The cards can be used as a companion for therapy, a springboard for journaling, or a storytelling resource. Essentially, they can be anything you want them to be.</p>
<p>>While you can certainly visit a tarot practitioner for a reading, you can also learn to read your own tarot cards. That way, you can define your relationship with them and determine how they can fit into your life.</p>
<p>Becoming acquainted with all 78 cards can be daunting and challenging, especially in the beginning. The deck is separated into 22 Major Arcana cards, which are thematically significant, and then 56 cards split up into four suits, each with a different energy. Each card has a different interpretation, and takes on new meaning when pulled in conjunction with other cards.</p>
<p>Hearing advice from professional readers can help guide your journey — because everyone has their own tips. As a professional astrologer and tarot reader, I find that taking notes in a journal of all the cards you’re pulling on a regular basis is helpful. My great grandmother, who read tarot during the Great Depression, taught me that if you are seeing similar cards over and over that they are trying to tell you a message. Keeping track of your tarot pulls can help you see the patterns and themes to pay attention to. </p>
